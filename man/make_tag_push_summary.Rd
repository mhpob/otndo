\usage{
make_tag_push_summary(
  matched = NULL,
  update_push_log = FALSE,
  since = NULL,
  sensor_decoding = NULL,
  out_dir = getwd(),
  rmd = FALSE,
  overwrite = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matched}{This argument also accepts a character vector of file paths of your matched detections. These can be CSVs or zipped folders.}

\item{update_push_log}{Do you wish to use an updated push log? Default is FALSE, but switch to TRUE if you haven't updated this package since the push occurred.}

\item{since}{date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Provides a summary of detections that were matched/edited since that date.}

\item{sensor_decoding}{Not yet implemented. Will be a place to provide information to decode and summarize sensor data,}

\item{out_dir}{Defaults to working directory. In which directory would you like to save the report?}

\item{rmd}{Logical. Compile via RMarkdown rather than Quarto?}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Overwrite existing file?}
