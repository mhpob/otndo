\title{Estimate transmitters remaining in the system}
\usage{
remaining_transmitters(matched, push_log, release = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{matched}{matched OTN transmitter detections}

\item{push_log}{data.frame containing the date of the most-recent data push.
This requirement is very likely to change in the future.}

\item{release}{Optional. Data frame of release times/locations; a subset of
the matched detections data}
}
\description{
This function estimates the transmitters remaining in the system by finding
the last date of detection for each transmitter and summing all available
transmitters in a given day. This is a very coarse measure and likely to be
very inaccurate with sparse data or short time scales.
