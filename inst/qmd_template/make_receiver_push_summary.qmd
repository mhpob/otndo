These are data related to receiver data from the `r format(push_log$date[nrow(push_log)], '%B %Y')` OTN data push. New matched detection files (["qualified" files](https://members.oceantrack.org/data/otn-detection-extract-documentation-matched-to-animals#autotoc-item-autotoc-2)) were uploaded on `r format(push_log$date[nrow(push_log)], '%B %d')`. The previous data push occurred on `r format(push_log$date[nrow(push_log) - 1], '%B %d, %Y')`.


## Overall

A total of `r format(nrow(qualified), big.mark = ',')` detections of `r uniqueN(qualified, by  = 'fieldnumber')` individuals have been matched via [ACT](`r act`), [FACT](https://secoora.org/fact/projects/), and/or [OTN](`r otn`). The detections span across `r uniqueN(qualified, by = 'trackercode')` different projects consisting of `r length(unique(unlist(strsplit(pis$PI, ',\\s?'))))` principal investigators.

```

Since `r format(since_date, '%B %Y')`, `r format(nrow(new_matches), big.mark = ',')` detections of `r uniqueN(new_matches, by  = 'fieldnumber')` individuals have been updated or newly-matched.

## Unmatched detections

```{r}
#| label: unqualified

unqual_f <- unqualified[, .N, by = "fieldnumber"][N <= 1]
data.table::setnames(unqual_f, c("Transmitter", "N"))

unqual_real <- unqualified[, .N, by = "fieldnumber"][N > 1]
data.table::setnames(unqual_real, c("Transmitter", "N"))
```

Some detections were not matched to other investigators via OTN nodes. There are `r format(nrow(unqualified), big.mark = ',')` of these ["unqualified" detections](https://members.oceantrack.org/data/otn-detection-extract-documentation-matched-to-animals#autotoc-item-autotoc-2) across `r data.table::uniqueN(unqualified, by  = 'fieldnumber')` transmitters.

`r nrow(unqual_f)` of these are very likely false, as they only have one detection; this leaves detections of `r nrow(unqual_real)` transmitters that could find a home elsewhere.

### Likely false detections (N detections = 1)

```{r}
#| label: unqualified-false


## NOTE TO SELF START HERE
reactable(unqual_f)
```

### Possibly real detections (N detections > 1)

#| label: unqualified-real

```
